For this project, I was interestested in using the Stack Overflow Data - 2017 Survey Data to better understand:

    Is There a Relation to Income based on work experience
    Is There a Difference in Genders in relatiopn to pay?
    What Countries have the Highest Income and what Cournties are the most underpaid?

File Descriptions

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.


Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data. You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available here. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
